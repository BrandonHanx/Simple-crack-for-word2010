This document provides the following information to properly run the WordCrak.cpp program:

1. The input of the program is the path of a docx file, and the output is the cracked password

2. It is better to put the files to be cracked in this directory to reduce the occurrence of errors (IMPORTANT!!)

3. This program can only crack the 2010 version of Office Word file with the password of 000-999. Do not use it for other files.It doesn't work

4. Please do not change any library files in this folder

5. encrypted office file.docx is the original file provided by the teacher. The password is 813

6. test001.docx, test505.docx and test399.docx are all test files, and the passwords are 001, 505 and 399 respectively

7. result.txt saves the final cracking result

8. temporary.txt is the intermediate file of program running, which is the result of reading docx file by fread function, which can be ignored
